# What is this?

This is a sample project for the STM32F042K6 Nucleo board that I'm
happy with. It has the following features:

- CMake for builds
- crosstool-ng for building a toolchain
- Unity for unit testing on the host
- OpenOCD and gdb for running code on the target

# How do I get started?

## Installing the toolchain
