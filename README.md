# What is this?

This is a demo of a from-scratch bring-up of the STM32F042 Nucleo
board, using a gcc toolchain, unit tests, and CMake for
cross-compiling.

# What are the pieces?

crosstool-ng is used to build the toolchain

cmake is used to build the code

openocd is used to talk to the board

Unity is used for unit testing the code, primarily by running the
tests on the host machine
